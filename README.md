  A) To REQUEST data from the microservice (NFLstats.py), you must write a random number to player-stats.txt. <br />
  For example: <br />

  B) To RECIEVE data from the microservice you must first import the library ast. This library helps us handle txt file data and interprut it as python data. This will be helpful since the data recieved via txt file will be in a list format. <br />
  An example of this: <br />
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe66eccd-90c0-47e5-ac5a-dba89791a1c3) <br />

  Next step you must do to recieve the data is by opening the txt file player-stats.txt in read mode and save everything in it into a variable. This variable with contain a list in which it contains a first and last name, and college name. <br />
  An example of this: <br />

# Mitigation Plan
  A) I implemented my microservice for Travis. <br />

  B) The microservice is complete! <br />

  C) <br />

  D) I will have my code in GitHub <br />
        https://github.com/seiferco/NFL-Microservice-A/tree/main <br />
        You should run my code locally. <br />
        
  E) If you cannot access/call the microservice, you are always welcome to text me or shoot me an email. <br />
        
  F) If you cannot access my microservice, I need to know before November 31st. <br />

  G) Just a reminder, the random number you generate to make a request with, must be within the bounds of [1,23733]. This is due to the number of NFL players in the dataset.
